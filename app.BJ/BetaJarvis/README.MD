Hello, I'm your assistant Jarvis, or rather its beta version, however, I already can something.

I will accept your commands via the command line, one of them 'help' will help you to get familiar with the rest of the functions.
And the hint function will help us understand each other. As your assistant, I will keep your contact book, keep it
not only names and phone numbers, but also birthdays, addresses (both physical and electronic mailboxes). I can tell you
how many days until the birthday, sort the files in the specified folder. And of course I will keep your notes.
I was created for your convenience, so let me show myself.
